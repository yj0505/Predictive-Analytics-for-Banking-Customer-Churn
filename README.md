# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

Developed an end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline for a retail banking dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced preprocessing (SMOTE for class imbalance, log transformation for skewed features, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables).

Built and compared multiple machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Achieved ~85% testing accuracy and an AUC of 0.86, demonstrating strong discriminative power in predicting customer churn.

Applied SHAP explainability techniques to identify key churn drivers (e.g., number of banking products, account balance, customer age, and activity level), providing actionable business insights.

Delivered business recommendations such as cross-selling strategies, senior-citizen retention programs, and customer engagement incentives, enabling the bank to design targeted retention campaigns.
